Hummingbird (the bird)
  *Hummingbirds are among the smallest of birds. They hover in mid-air at rapid wing flapping rates,
  typically around 50 times per second, but possibly as high as 200 times per second,
  allowing them also to fly at speeds exceeding 15 m/s (54 km/h; 34 mph),
  backwards or upside down. [..].* (Wikipedia_).

A Web Processing Service for metadata compliance checks used in the climate science community.

Hummingbird is part of the `Birdhouse <http://bird-house.github.io>`_ project.
